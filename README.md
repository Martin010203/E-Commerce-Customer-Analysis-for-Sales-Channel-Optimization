# E-Commerce Customer Analysis for Sales Channel Optimization

## Overview

This project aims to help Fyntra, the largest online clothing company in the USA, decide whether to focus its resources on the mobile app or the website for better customer engagement and increased sales. The goal is to analyze customer behavior data and recommend which sales channel would yield the most profit based on factors like time spent on the website/app, yearly amount spent, and membership length.
## Key Features

* Data cleaning and exploration of customer behavior data.
* Comparison of correlations between time spent on the website/app 
  and yearly amount spent.
* Identification of the most correlated feature with yearly amount 
  spent.
* Linear regression analysis to predict yearly amount spent based 
  on the length of membership.
* Model evaluation using performance metrics such as RMSE (Root 
  Mean Squared Error).
* Recommendations on whether Fyntra should prioritize its mobile  
  app or website.
## Technology Used

* Programming Languages: Python
* Libraries & Frameworks:
   - Pandas
   - NumPy
   - Matplotlib
   - Seaborn
   - Scikit-learn
* Tools: Jupyter Notebook, GitHub, Anaconda
